Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most 
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?  

Compile the source code after fixing the typo in:
 if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
 
 and then try various inputs.
 
 Inputs like tab and then EOF (^D in Linux, ^Z in Visual Studio) will cause the program
 to incorrectly count a word and two characters (at least in Visual Studio is does).
